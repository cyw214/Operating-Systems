this is a line with the word hello
hell is a place where the christians put bad people
monsieur gustave has a hell of a collection of collogne
alone alone, all alone, alone on the wide wide sea
blah blah blah
to see the world in a grain of sand,
and heaven in a wild flouwer,
hold infinity in the palm of your hand, 
and eternity in an hour.
